# ML General Concepts

## Important Python Libraries

- **Pandas** : Useful for data synthesis, converting data to table, series (row of data). Works with numpy library for statistical computation
- **Matplotlib** : Data visualization
- **Seaborn** : Advanced Matplotlib
- **scikit_learn** : Machine Learning libraries
- **tensorflow** : Uses APIs such as Keras to apply neural network models

## Different types of data

- Numerical : Population
  - Discrete Data
  - Continuous Data
- Categorical : Groups, demographies
- Ordinal : Star ratings

## Data Distributions

- Normal Distribution: Probability Density, Bell curve. Mean is more dense in the population
- Probability Mass Function: Probability Density on a discrete data. Represented as historam. AKA Poisson Distribution
- Binomial Distribution: Multiple trials with possibility of pass or fail
- Bernoulli Distribution: Single Trial with possibility of pass or fail
- Time Series Analysis: Trend over time + Seasonality + Noise
